sorting-algorithms
=============================

A collection of sorting algorithms in JavaScript. Uses Jasmine to run tests out of index.html.

To use the following Grunt scripts, make sure you've installed the appropriate node modules by running npm install from the project root.

For building a minified production version, run grunt dist. You really only need /dist/scripts/sorting-algorithms.min.js. The rest is just Jasmine tests.
