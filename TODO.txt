- Integrate Matt's method for producing random data sets to test on
- fix up quick sort alt
- Finalize the benchmark.js integration. Not sure if grunt-benchmark cuts it. I guess I can extend it to allow you to load external files to run benchmark on.
- Run all data type tests in benchmarks
- Add other algorithms
  - include a comparison to the native sort
  - heap sort
- include link to that algorithm visualizer
- fix up the readme
